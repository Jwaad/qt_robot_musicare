# Data to save level data as well as user player data

## Structure of save files:
Only the information inside the curly brackets are used, so you can write whatever you want else where.

Song data should be seperated with a pound sign followed by a hashtag in between to differentiate them and made the code that reads them easier
The directory that the code defaults in is the folder that contains the "happy" and "sad" folders, so the song_names should also include the folder theyre in.

Data should have the label of the data followed by an equals sign, and then the data all empty spaces are removed and ignored, so the spaces after the equals are of no consequence

The order of the brackets matters, the top most bracket is easy, then next bracket is medium, then the 3rd will be hard.
Songs should be put in order of their level numbers
